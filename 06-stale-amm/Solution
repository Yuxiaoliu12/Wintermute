It’s May 2021, and while searching for new trading pools, you discovered that someone made 2.8x by selling TUSD through one of the old Uniswap v1 pools. Let’s figure out how it happened.

a) What is the reason for the stale price in this pool?
b) Provide all necessary simulation data to arbitrage the pool on January 23, 2022.
c) Could you execute the arbitrage on March 14, 2022? If not, explain why.

a)
Uniswap V2 was launched in 2020. Since then most liquidity providers switched to V2 and very little trading took place in V1.

b)
I had trouble accessing V1 pool data from Dune, Alchemy, etc. In the end, I had to reverse engineer the pool's reserve by tracking historical transactions in the pool on EtherScan.
In fact, there was no activity in the pool since 2021/12/05, so the state of the pool on January 23, 2022 would be the same as now. There are 0.67157 ETH and 2400 TUSD in the pool.
The constant k from 0.67157x2400 is 1611.

The price of ETH on January 23, 2022 is 2407 USD, lower than 2400/0.67157=3573. With k=1611, if we sell y TUSD to the pool, we get 0.67157-1611/(2400+y) ETH.
Our profit would then be 2407(0.67157-1611/(2400+y))-y. However, since the pool is so small, this function is only positive from 0 to 2.35.

Let's examine the other direction. If we sell x ETH to the pool, we get 2400-1611/(0.6715786+x) TUSD.
Our profit would then be 2400-1611/(0.6715786+x)-2407x. The maximum takes place at x=0.14653 and attains 78. 

c)
The price of ETH on Mar 14, 2022 is 2518 USD. Plugging in 2518 for 2407, we get a maximum of 62.8 at x=0.12829.
